# Sentiment Analysis Model (NLP & Machine Learning)

## Project Overview
This repository contains a functional proof-of-concept for a Sentiment Analysis model developed using Python. The goal of this project is to classify raw text input (such as reviews or social media comments) into distinct sentiment categories (Positive/Negative).

## Key Skills Demonstrated:
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Model training, evaluation, and serialization.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Data cleaning, text vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF).
- **Python:** Robust data handling using Pandas and Scikit-learn.

## Files Included:
- `sentimente_analysis_Project.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the full development pipeline (data loading, cleaning, training, evaluation, and prediction function).
- `Test.csv`: Dataset used for training and validation.

## Status & Next Steps
This model serves as a core demonstration of my capability in delivering custom Data Science solutions. I am committed to clean code and high performance.
